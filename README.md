# üá∫üá¨ Realtime Voting Engineering üó≥Ô∏è

**Project Repository:** [GitHub Link](https://github.com/Smartlyfe21/RealtimeVotingEngineering.git)  

A **real-time voting system** built for Uganda‚Äôs upcoming 2026 general election, designed to simulate and display live election results for the three leading candidates. This system demonstrates a novel approach to election monitoring using modern **data engineering, streaming, and visualization technologies**.  

---

## üìå Overview

- This project simulates a **real-time voting platform** for Uganda, a country that currently does not have live election monitoring.
- It focuses on the **top three presidential candidates**:  
  1. **Yoweri Museveni** ‚Äì National Resistance Movement (NRM)  
  2. **Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu** ‚Äì National Unity Platform (NUP)  
  3. **Mugisha Muntu** ‚Äì Alliance for National Transformation (ANT)  
- The system collects votes, processes them in real-time, and displays **live vote counts** along with visualizations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

1. **Real-time Vote Streaming**  
   - Votes are produced and consumed using **Kafka**.  
   - Each vote includes: candidate, district, timestamp, and slogan.  

2. **Database Management**  
   - Votes and voter data are stored in **PostgreSQL**.  
   - Tables include `candidates`, `voters`, and `votes_stream`.  

3. **Candidate Management**  
   - Insert, store, and display information about each candidate including:  
     - Biography  
     - Campaign platform  
     - Slogan  
     - Image  

4. **Live Dashboard**  
   - Shows real-time vote counts per candidate.  
   - Displays pie charts (currently screenshot-based) for vote distribution.  
   - Candidate images can be displayed alongside live vote counts.  

5. **Multithreading & Realistic Simulation**  
   - Simulates up to 50,000 voters with multi-threading.  
   - Gradual probability-based vote assignment ensures realistic results.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python** ‚Äì Core programming language  
- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì Relational database for storing voters, candidates, and votes  
- **Kafka** ‚Äì Real-time vote streaming  
- **Faker** ‚Äì Generating fake voter data for simulation  
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)** ‚Äì Displaying candidate images  
- **Multithreading** ‚Äì Handling large-scale vote insertion and simulation  
- **Dashboard Visualizations** ‚Äì Pie charts and live vote updates

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Install dependencies:**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Install dependencies:**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Start PostgreSQL database and create votes_db.
Run the main script:
python main.py

Producer and consumer threads will automatically start, simulating votes and streaming them to Kafka.
View live dashboard to monitor vote counts and pie chart visualization.
